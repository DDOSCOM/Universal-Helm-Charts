# Universal Kubernetes Helm Charts

This is a set of standardized helm charts meant for installation of best-practice services on Kubernetes.  They support a wide range of usages but generally are to be used in combination with the rest of the DevOps Nirvana stack.  Feel free to adopt/adapt them and/or submit bug requests and/or fixes!
